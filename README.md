# MERN-Location-Logger
MERN stack application that allows authenticated users to post locations and other users( authenticated or not) to view them

Any registered authenticated user will be able to post about a place. The authenticated user will be able to edit, and delete their own posts.
The authenticated user will also be able to view other user's registered to the platform and view the places they have logged. They are however unable to edit 
or delete other users location logs.

Any non-registered or non authenticated users will only be able to view a list of users connected to the platform, and only view the locations other users have logged.
These users will therefore be unable to edit or delete another users post.

In this project, the currently missing things are  password encryption, and some minor bug fixes regarding image uploads.
